Local Search
============
Local Search tries a number of moves on the current solution and picks the best accepted move as the step.
It uses search path instead of search tree.
(Tries all selected moves, but unless it's the step, it doesn't investigate the solution further.)

Three components are used to decide the next step:
(1)	Move_Selector 	: Select possible moves of the current solution
(2)     Acceptor 	: Filters out unacceptable moves (hard constraint)
(3)	Forager		: Gathers accepted moves and picks the next step from them.


Hill Climbing
------------- 
- greedy local search algorithm
- can become stuck in a local optimum
